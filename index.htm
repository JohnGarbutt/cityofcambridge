The band was formed in 1900 and has had several changes of name over the years; names include Cambridge Town Band, the Cambridge Band of the British Legion, Cambridge Band, Cambridge Co-operative Band and, currently, the City of Cambridge Brass Band. We rehearse on a Monday and Wednesday, 8pm to 10pm, in <a href="http://www.trumpingtonresidentsassociation.org/Trumpington_Village_Hall_0804.html" target="_blank"> Trumpington Village Hall</a>.

<p>Over the years the band has enjoyed success on the contest stage, undertaken various recordings and radio broadcasts, performed on television and in high profile concerts. The band 
has been be in the first section from January 2012, having been in the championship section for 2009, 2010 and 2011. In recent times, the band has represented London and the Southern Counties at the National Brass Band Finals in Harrogate in 2007, performed twice in Ely Cathedral (sharing the stage, in 2010, with June Whitfield and Roger Lloyd Pack), organised a tour of local churches, performed an experimental piece for brass band and electronic instruments, featured in concerts in aid of local charities and played fanfares for the opening of the clock at Corpus Christi College. These are  in addition to numerous programmes of light music in local parks, weddings, garden shows and festivals.  Steve Phillips was appointed as Musical Director in 2010 and, under his direction, the band has undertaken its first ever performance outside of the UK. In May of this year the band performed in Paris with Parisian brass band Brassage and also in the Parc du Champs de Mars at the foot of the Eiffel tower.

Although the band actively seeks a sponsor to enable it to purchase new instruments and compete at the highest level, it is a registered charity (under the
                        Charities Commission no. 1083294) and currently relies on the money raised through performance fees and through the subscriptions paid by its members for the day-to-day costs associated with the hire of rehearsal facilities, purchase of music etc.  Further information about the band, its engagements plus how to book and support the band financially is available through this website.
