Tours with various bands have taken him throughout Europe and as far afield as Australia, America and Canada.

Steve has previously been musical director of Barnsley Building Society, South Yorkshire Police and Nottingham City Transport bands as well as Resident conductor of the Carlton Main Frickley Colliery Band.
